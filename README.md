## 🌍 **Why This Matters**

In Nepal, finding student accommodation can be tricky, with limited options and no dedicated platforms. We built this website to help students find their home away from home with ease. Verified hostels, transparent information, and direct communication with owners make the process smoother, fairer, and more affordable.
